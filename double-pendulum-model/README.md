#doublependulummodel

Double pendulum model is the one example usage of the runge kutta fourth order in solving hte ordinary differential equations. The problem that the equation is not solvable using the normal differential method, the runge kutta fourth order came in to make an approximation to the true value of the equations.

In the Untitled-1.ipynb you can run the single pendulum model and the double pendulum model right on the notebook. Make sure you have the python3 installed on the notebook.
