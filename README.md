Welcome to My Github Repository!

Here, you can see all code that I have written or modify for the past four years in undergraduate program. Currently, I am majoring on Biomedical Engineering, all my project is related to the at least medical stuff or something like that. 
There are at least several project that I have done, I name it on the folder, so you can see more easily, for the on going project I put it on the seperated branch so, this `master` branch only contain the final version of my project. But, these not limited to all circumstances, I can make changes if there something that I need to add to the code.

Big shout out to all my friend, who keep me motivated all the time, this repo is nothing without you guys. If you found that your code or all your work here and you feel that you can't share it to the public, please text me and I will remove it on my repository.

Fell free to give me feedback or send pull request if you have some modification.
